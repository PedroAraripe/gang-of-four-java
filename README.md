# Gang of Four Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains examples of Gang of Four design patterns implemented in Java. Each design pattern is categorized based on its type: creational, structural, and behavioral.

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

#### Examples:

- **[Main.java](creational/factory-method/Main.java)**: Demonstrates how to create different types of mosses and regions using the Factory Method pattern.
