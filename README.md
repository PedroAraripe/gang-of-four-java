# Gang of Four Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains examples of Gang of Four design patterns implemented in Java. Each design pattern is categorized based on its type: creational, structural, and behavioral.

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

#### Examples:
- **[Region.java](creational/factory-method/factory/Region.java)**: The Region factory needs implementation of the abstract method renderFirstLife(), wich returns a moss.
- **[Demo.java](creational/factory-method/Demo.java)**: Initialize the example above.


### Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

#### Examples:
- **[GamerPcFactory.java](creational/abstract-factory/factories/GamerPcFactory.java)**: The GamerPcFactory is a factory that uses the Processor interface and the storage Interface, agnostic of which model the pc is using.
- **[Demo.java](creational/abstract-factory//Demo.java)**: Initialize the example above.
